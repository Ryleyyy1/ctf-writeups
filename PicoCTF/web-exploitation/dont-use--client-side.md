## Description
This challenge demonstrates why client-side validation should never be trusted.  
The password verification logic is implemented entirely in JavaScript.

## Analysis
After inspecting the page source, a JavaScript function was found that validates the password using multiple `substring()` checks.

The flag is split into fixed-length segments and verified in a shuffled order.  
The order of the `if` statements does not represent the actual order of the flag.

## Exploitation
By analyzing each `substring(start, end)` condition, the correct position of each string segment was identified.

The segments were then reordered based on their index positions to reconstruct the full flag, without interacting with the server.
